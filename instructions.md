@ Kevin, Ken, Alexis

This is the repo where all of the code for our project will be stored.
It is divided into two folders, one for client where we will create our user-interface with react and one for the server where we will use Spring Boot.
To install this repo onto your own machine use the instructions below. Make sure you have visual studio code, node, and a java IDE for the backend.

Even if you won't be working on the frontend functionality, it's good to know how it works so definitely try to get the frontend running.

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS FOR FRONTEND:
1. Clone this repo from github to your computer (using git clone command with git bash on windows or terminal on mac)
3. To work on front end open up the folder in VSCode and navigate to the client folder
4. From here you can use the command 'npm install' in your terminal and it will download all of the dependencies needed for the project
5. once that is done you can run the site on localhost, to do so enter 'npm start' in your terminal (make sure you are in the right folder)


SETUP INSTRUCTIONS FOR BACKEND: 
1. Make sure Spring Applications work with your IDE, if not look up how to use spring on Intellij, Eclipse or whatever IDE you're using.
2. Generate spring project using spring initializr (this step will already be done as project folder is in repo, this is listed on here for reference) https://start.spring.io/
3.
