@ Kevin, Ken, Alexis

This is the repo where all of the code for our project will be stored.
It is divided into two folders, one for client where we will create our user-interface with react and one for the server where we will use Spring Boot.
To install this repo onto your own machine use the instructions below. Make sure you have visual studio code, node, and a java IDE for the backend.

Although I will be responsible for most of the frontend functionality, it's good to know how this stuff works so definitely try to get the frontend running on your machines.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR FRONTEND:
1. Clone this repo from github to your computer
3. To work on front end open up the folder in VSCode and navigate to the client folder
4. From here you can use the command 'npm install' in your terminal and it will download all of the dependencies needed for the project
5. once that is done you can run the site on localhost, to do so enter 'npm start' in your terminal (make sure you are in the right folder)
